    <p><em>A Dutch baby is a big, puffy, family-style pancake baked that often comes covered with wonderful toppings.</em></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A Dutch baby pancake, sometimes called a German pancake, a Bismarck, a Dutch puff, or a Hootenanny, is a large American popover</p>
    <p>Buttery and sweet, the plate sized pancake crawls up the side of the pan while cooking, resulting in a bowl-like shape perfect for introducing whatever extra flavors you want. I am particularly fond of powdered sugar and berries, but its even delicious with only cinnamon and butter!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p> The ingredients needed to make 3 to 4 dutch babies are:
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs, <strong>at room temperature</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk, <strong>at room temperature</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>Once you've gathered your ingredients follow these steps to assemble and bake your Dutch Babies:
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425째F or 218째C</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, flour, milk, sugar, and nutmeg. Whisk until <em>very</em> smooth.</li>
            <li>Place butter into a 10-inch skillet or cake pan and place in the oven. As soon as the butter has melted, (be sure it does not burn) add the batter to the pan. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancake is puffed and golden.</li>
            <li>Lower the oven temperature to 300째F or 148째C and bake for 5 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Remove pancake from oven, cut into wedges, and throw on your toppings!</li>
